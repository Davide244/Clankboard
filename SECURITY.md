## Supported Versions
I do not fix security issues in older versions.
You may also not report security vulnerabilities from INDEV versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
<ins>**Do not** report severe security vulnerabilites as issues!</ins><br><br>
Examples of severe vulnerabilites include: **(Remote) code execution**, **cryptographic failures**, **Vulnerabilities in the APO or driver objects related to clankboard**, **PC crashing exploits**, etc.<br><br>
They do NOT include: *(App) crashing exploits*, etc.<br><br>
If a severe security vulnerability is found, email admin@davicloud.net or DM [davide_24](discord://-/users/482217763855925248) on discord.
If possible, provide all details, evidence, and code snippets for reproduction. Reports without a somewhat thorough description will most likely be ignored.
